<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>This project is a simple survey form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter basic personal preferences, such as their favorite color, food, and a fun fact about themselves. When users submit their answers, the form displays a confirmation message with their responses.</p>

<h1>Why I Chose This Project</h1>
<p>I created this project to practice creating forms and to practice basic JavaScript functionalities. This project helped reinforce my understanding of forms, event handling, and styling form elements to improve user experience.</p>
